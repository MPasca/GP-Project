# GP-Project
GP final project

I created a scene in blender that looks like a studio apartment with a bedroom, a kitchen, a living room and a bathroom (that's unfurnished at the moment).
The user can navigate freely in here and interact with a given set of objects (for example the bathroom door, the cereal box, the book, the TV, and the sound system).
